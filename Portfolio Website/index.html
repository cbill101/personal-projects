				<p>Thanks for dropping by... My name is Chris Billingsley. I'm a Sophomore at the University of Utah.
				I'm currently a CS major. This is surprising to me, as I have considered a completely different path several years ago.
				My desire to go into CS emerged very recently, when I was a middle school student. That was the time when
				I took my very first programming class. After that, despite my frustrations, I knew the CS field was where I wanted to be.</p>
				<p>Before high school, I wanted to go into the medical field. I was one of the cookie cutter kids who
				wanted to be a doctor. I also thought about being a pharmacist. At some point, I even thought about
				becoming a police officer!</p>
				<p style = "font-style:italic; text-align:center; text-indent:0px; ";>That all changed.</p>
				<p>It all refers back to my love for gaming. I played on several consoles in the past, such as the PS1,
				Nintendo 64, Xbox 360, and PS4. However, I started to discover PC gaming. In the process, I did a LOT
				of research. This research consisted of learning new hardware knowledge, figuring out compatibilities,
				and other things. I eventually became obsessed with researching this to the point where I learned about
				why all of these components exist: their purposes, fucntions, roles in the team of hardware working to
				make today's modern marvel: the computer.</p>
				<p>After all of this research, I naturally thought about how games were made. I wanted to know how they
				were created. I wanted to know how it all came together. Thus, my programming journey began. In 9th grade,
				I decided to learn a programming language: Python. It was a very simple language to learn, and I enjoyed it.
				I have not coded in Python for a long time, but it should be easy to pick up again. In high school, I learned
				bits and pieces of C# and Java, in formal programming courses. In contrast to Python, I did not like how 
				I learned those languages initially. I felt like I was held back and not properly taught. As a result,
				I learned the majority of programming concepts on my own, and learned what and what not to do along the way.
				My projects will demonstrate my frustration from past courses. I made many mistakes that I didn't know WERE
				mistakes. However, that is all a part of learning.</p>
